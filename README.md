## 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel

A polyglot software engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria. At work, I mainly focus on building backend systems.

- I’m particularly passionate about developing tiny tools for fun, learning about distributed systems and artificial intelligence (mostly RL).
- I’m looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals.
- I have a [blog](https://danielbrai.dev/blog) where I write about my experiences so far.
- You can out to reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-o-brai/) and [E-mail](mailto:danielbrai.dev@gmail.com)
